# Title
Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction Algorithm Using Convex Geometry and K-Means

# Abstract
Hyperspectral unmixing is a technique of approximating spectral signatures of pure types and their corresponding combined proportions at all pixels in the hyperspectral data. Hyperspectral unmixing is a noteworthy task for understanding, study and visualization of hyperspectral image. In this task, extracting pure spectral signatures is very challenging. In this paper, a novel approach, using convex geometry and k-means concepts, is proposed for endmember extraction. The majority of existing techniques of endmember extraction uses only convex geometry. Using K-means with convex geometry improves the accuracy of the extraction process. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-art algorithms using simulated and real-world datasets. Based on simulation results, it is seen that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-art algorithms.
